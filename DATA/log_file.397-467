    have 15 copies of this form mod 3 and am expecting at least 1
    have 2 copies of this form mod 5 and am expecting at least 1
    have 2 copies of this form mod 7 and am expecting at least 1
    have 3 copies of this form mod 11 and am expecting at least 1
    have 4 copies of this form mod 13 and am expecting at least 1
    too many forms found --- will need to compute mod p with more p (evenutually) --- going on to next form
Need to make another mod p computation and try again...
