Starting mod p computations to determine possible minimal polynomials of FC's
------
   Working with p = 5:
     Forming modsym space
    Decomposing by Hecke away from p
      decomposing with Hecke operator at 2 -- dimensions: [180]
      decomposing with Hecke operator at 3 -- dimensions: [92]
      decomposing with Hecke operator at 7 -- dimensions: [62]
      decomposing with Hecke operator at 11 -- dimensions: [2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 8]
      decomposing with Hecke operator at 13 -- dimensions: [4, 6, 4, 4]
      decomposing with Hecke operator at 17 -- dimensions: [4]
      decomposing with Hecke operator at 19 -- dimensions: [4]
      passing to ordinary subspaces -- dimensions: [4]
      final dimensions: [4]
    After decomposition into eigenspaces the upper bound is 2
We now remove 1 CM form(s)
  Trying to remove CM form {2: 0, 3: 0, 5: 0, 7: -1, 11: 0, 13: 0, 17: 0, 19: 0}
    have 2 copies of this form mod 5 and am expecting at least 1
    too many forms found --- will need to compute mod p with more p (evenutually) --- going on to next form
Need to make another mod p computation and try again...
