  Trying to remove CM form {2: b, 3: 0, 5: -b - 1, 7: 0, 11: 0, 13: 0, 17: -1, 19: 0}
    have 2 copies of this form mod 2 and am expecting at least 1
    have 2 copies of this form mod 5 and am expecting at least 1
    have 1 copies of this form mod 3 and am expecting at least 1
  can safely remove the CM form {2: b, 3: 0, 5: -b - 1, 7: 0, 11: 0, 13: 0, 17: -1, 19: 0}

  Trying to remove CM form {2: -b, 3: 0, 5: 0, 7: 0, 11: 0, 13: 0, 17: 0, 19: 0}
    have 2 copies of this form mod 3 and am expecting at least 1
    have 5 copies of this form mod 2 and am expecting at least 1
    have 1 copies of this form mod 13 and am expecting at least 1
  can safely remove the CM form {2: -b, 3: 0, 5: 0, 7: 0, 11: 0, 13: 0, 17: 0, 19: 0}

    too many forms found --- will need to compute mod p with more p (eventually) --- going on to next form

    have 2 copies of this form mod 5 and am expecting at least 1
    too many forms found --- will need to compute mod p with more p (eventually) --- going on to next form

  Trying to remove CM form {2: 0, 3: -1, 5: -1, 7: 0, 11: 0, 13: 0, 17: 0, 19: 0}
    have 5 copies of this form mod 5 and am expecting at least 1
    too many forms found --- will need to compute mod p with more p (eventually) --- going on to next form
Need to make another mod p computation and try again...
