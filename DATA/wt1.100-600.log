Working with level 100
 There are 4 spaces to consider

Working with Dirichlet character modulo 100 of conductor 4 mapping 51 |--> -1, 77 |--> 1
 Working with p = 3: 
Forming modsym space
Using T_2 on 16-dimensional space
  Collecting irreducible factors with doubled socle and Artin type
    Poly = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is doubled.  Checking Artin and eigen-doubled
      not eigen-doubled
  -nothing there after intersection
Weight 1 space has no exotic forms
time: 0.792

Working with Dirichlet character modulo 100 of conductor 25 mapping 51 |--> 1, 77 |--> zeta20
